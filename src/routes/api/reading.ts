/**
 * POST /api/reading — spends one credit and stores the drawn reading.
 *
 * Called once the cards are down. The server re-checks that the order is paid
 * and has a credit left, so the spend can never be faked into existence; the
 * reading itself is composed client-side from the Core deck, which is public
 * data, so there is nothing secret to protect in the payload.
 *
 * This is what makes the Reading Bundle a real product: three paid draws
 * tracked server-side, each one saved and re-readable later.
 *
 * Request:  { "orderId": "<uuid>", "reading": { ...cards, question, summary } }
 * Response: { "readingId": "<uuid>", "creditsLeft": 2 }
 *           402 when the order is unpaid or exhausted.
