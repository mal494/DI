/**
 * orders.ts — server-only order + entitlement store for Divine Insight.
 *
 * This is the trust boundary. Before this file existed, fulfilment was
 * honor-based: the CTA opened a Stripe payment link in a new tab and the draw
 * was never gated, so a paid reading was free to anyone who found the page.
 *
 * The rule now: an order becomes `paid` in exactly one place — the Stripe
 * webhook, after Stripe's own signature has been verified. Nothing the browser
 * sends can mark an order paid, and the price of each SKU is read from the
 * table below rather than from the request, so a tampered client can only ever
 * buy what it actually paid for.
 *
 * Never import this from a component. It is for `createServerFn()` handlers and
 * `src/routes/api/*` routes only.
